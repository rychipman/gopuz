# gopuz

Golang library for reading and writing crossword puzzles in the `.puz` file format. Parsing based on [this file format documentation](http://code.google.com/p/puz/wiki/FileFormat).

## Work In Progress

The library is still undergoing development, but aims to accurately enforce all the same details as Across Lite, including checksums/magic strings.
